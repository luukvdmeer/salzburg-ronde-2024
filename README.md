# Salzburg Ronde 2024

A road bike route for Flandriens in Salzburg with various short but steep hills, loads of narrow farm roads, and many churches and chapels along the way. The only thing we can't offer are the cobbles. Around 10 climbs are be classified, each representing a famous "berg" from the Tour of Flanders. You are challenged to ride them as fast as you can. At the end of the weekend of 30-31st of March 2024, we check the Strava leaderboard to see who crowned themselves as the king and queen of each "berg".
